classdef opChol < opFactorization
%opCHOL  Operator representing the Cholesky factorization of a
%        symmetric and definite matrix with optional iterative
%        refinement. Only the lower triangle of the input matrix
%        is referenced.
%
%   opChol(A) creates an operator for multiplication by the
%   inverse of the matrix A implicitly represented by its Cholesky
%   factorization. Optionally, iterative refinement is performed.
%   Note that A is an explicit matrix.
%
%   The following attributes may be changed by the user:
%    * nitref : the maximum number of iterative refinement steps (3)
%    * itref_tol : iterative refinement tolerance (1.0e-8)
%    * force_itref : force iterative refinement (false)
%
