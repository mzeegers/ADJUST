classdef opLU < opFactorization
%opLU    Operator representing the LU factorization of a
%        matrix with optional iterative refinement. If the matrix
%        is known to be symmetric, opLDL will be more efficient.
%        If in addition, the matrix is known to be definite,
%        opChol will be more efficient.
%
%   opLU(A) creates an operator for multiplication by the (pseudo-)
%   inverse of the matrix A implicitly represented by its LU
%   factorization. Optionally, iterative refinement is performed.
%   Note that A is an explicit matrix.
%
%   The following attributes may be changed by the user:
%    * nitref : the maximum number of iterative refinement steps (3)
%    * itref_tol : iterative refinement tolerance (1.0e-8)
%    * force_itref : force iterative refinement (false)
%
%   See also lu.
