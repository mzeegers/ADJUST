classdef opiChol < opFactorization
%opiChol   Operator representing the incomplete Cholesky factorization of a
%          symmetric and definitematrix with optional iterative refinement.
%
%   opiChol(A) creates an operator for multiplication by an approximate
%   inverse of the matrix A implicitly represented by its incomplete
%   Cholesky factorization. Optionally, iterative refinement is performed.
%   Note that A is an explicit matrix.
%
%   Additional input arguments are passed directly to ichol() with the
%   exception of the 'shape' attribute.
%
%   The following attributes may be changed by the user:
%    * nitref : the maximum number of iterative refinement steps (3)
%    * itref_tol : iterative refinement tolerance (1.0e-8)
%    * force_itref : force iterative refinement (false)
%
%   See also ichol.
