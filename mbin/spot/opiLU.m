classdef opiLU < opFactorization
%opiLU   Operator representing the incomplete LU factorization of a
%        matrix with optional iterative refinement. If the matrix
%        is known to be symmetric and definite, opiChol will be more
%        efficient.
%
%   opiLU(A) creates an operator for multiplication by an approximate
%   inverse of the matrix A implicitly represented by its incomplete LU
%   factorization. Optionally, iterative refinement is performed.
%   Note that A is an explicit matrix.
%
%   Additional input arguments are passed directly to ilu().
%
%   The following attributes may be changed by the user:
%    * nitref : the maximum number of iterative refinement steps (3)
%    * itref_tol : iterative refinement tolerance (1.0e-8)
%    * force_itref : force iterative refinement (false)
%
%   See also ilu.
