# OneStepSpectralCT
This package contains Matlab code for spectral CT one-step inversion. 
It consists in implementations of five different methods, which are compared
in the paper "Comparison of five one-step reconstruction algorithms for spectral CT",
by Cyril Mory, Bruno Sixou, Salim Si-mohamed, Lo√Øc Boussel and Simon Rit. 
You can access it in its submitted version following this link:
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01760845/document

The "Notes" folder contains a LaTeX document with our notes, which should help the 
interested reader to re-do the math of each of the five original papers in which the compared
methods are described. You can have it compiled on-the-fly by visiting this address:

We appreciate any relevant contribution to either the Matlab code or the notes. Please
submit them via a pull request on github.
