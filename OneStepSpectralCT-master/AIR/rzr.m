function [A,b] = rzr(A,b,Nthr)
%rzr  Remove zero rows of A and the corresponding elements of b.
%
% [A,b] = rzr(A,b)
% [A,b] = rzr(A,b,Nthr)
%
% Identifies zero rows of the coefficient matrix A and removes them.
% If a right-hand side b is present, the corresponding elements of
% b are also removed.
%
% If a positive Nthr is given as the third argument, then all rows with
% less than or equal to Nthr nonzero elements are removed.
%
% Use this function to 'clean up' a discretized tomography problem.
% Zero rows do not contribute to the reconstruction.
% Rows with few nonzero elements correspond to pixels near the corners of
% the image, whose reconstructions are highly sensitive to noise.
